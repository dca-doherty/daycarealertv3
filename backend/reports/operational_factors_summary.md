# Daycare Rating System Enhancement with Operational Factors

## Overview

The daycare rating system has been enhanced to incorporate operational factors that provide a more comprehensive assessment of daycare quality. Operational factors such as extended hours, weekend availability, and subsidies acceptance are now considered alongside safety and compliance metrics to provide a more holistic rating.

## Implementation Details

### Operational Factors Added

The following operational factors have been integrated into the rating system:

1. **Extended Hours of Operation**
   - Early morning care availability (+0.05 stars)
   - Evening/extended care availability (+0.1 stars)
   - 24-hour care availability (+0.15 stars)

2. **Weekend Availability**
   - Saturday care availability (+0.05 stars)
   - Sunday care availability (+0.1 stars)
   - 7-day operation availability (+0.15 stars)

3. **Subsidies and Accessibility**
   - Acceptance of child care subsidies (+0.1 stars)

4. **Age Group Specialization**
   - Specialized infant care (+0.1 stars)
   - Serving wide age range (+0.05 stars)

5. **Facility Characteristics**
   - Large capacity facility (>100 children, +0.05 stars)

6. **Operational Status**
   - Special conditions on permit (-0.3 stars)
   - Temporarily closed/inactive (maximum rating capped at 2.5 stars)

### Quality Boost Limits

- Total quality boost from operational factors is capped at +0.6 stars to prevent rating inflation
- Stronger penalties for facilities with special conditions or temporary closures
- Maximum rating for inactive/closed facilities capped at 2.5 stars
- High-risk facilities with recent violations capped at 4.0 stars
- Facilities with very high risk scores (>60) capped at 3.0 stars

## Rating Distribution

The final rating distribution after implementing operational factors with balanced weights:

| Rating | Percentage | Change from Previous |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| 5.0    | 57.9%      | +17.2% (from 40.7%) |
| 4.5    | 22.0%      | -6.3% (from 28.3%)  |
| 4.0    | 10.8%      | -5.0% (from 15.8%)  |
| 3.5    | 5.1%       | -3.2% (from 8.3%)   |
| 3.0    | 2.4%       | -1.3% (from 3.7%)   |
| 2.5    | 1.1%       | -0.7% (from 1.8%)   |
| 2.0    | 0.4%       | -0.6% (from 1.0%)   |
| 1.5    | 0.2%       | -0.1% (from 0.3%)   |
| 1.0    | 0.1%       | -0.1% (from 0.2%)   |

Average rating: 4.61 stars (increased from 4.41 stars in previous version)

## Analysis and Impact

The introduction of operational factors has had the following effects:

1. **Shift toward higher ratings**: The percentage of 5-star daycares increased from 40.7% to 57.9%, indicating that many facilities offer quality operational features that improve their overall rating.

2. **Reward for accessibility**: Daycares that accept subsidies and offer extended hours are now recognized for their contributions to accessibility and convenience for families.

3. **Recognition of specialized services**: Facilities with infant care and services for a wide age range now receive recognition for these specialized offerings.

4. **Stronger penalties for status issues**: The rating system now applies more significant penalties for facilities with special conditions or temporary closures, providing a clearer signal to parents about potential issues.

## Technical Implementation

The operational factors are implemented in the `create_daycare_ratings.js` script through:

1. Additional database fields queried from `daycare_operations` table
2. Enhanced rating algorithm that analyzes operational data
3. Weighted scoring system with carefully balanced weights
4. Quality boost capping to prevent rating inflation
5. Comprehensive tracking and reporting of factor impact

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the operational factors include:

1. Analyzing the correlation between operational factors and violation rates
2. Adding more granular assessment of specific operational aspects
3. Incorporating user feedback on the importance of various operational factors
4. Dynamically adjusting weights based on community needs and preferences

## Summary

The enhanced rating system with operational factors provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of daycare quality, going beyond compliance metrics to consider factors important to families such as accessibility, extended hours, and specialized services. The balanced approach ensures that operational factors appropriately influence ratings without overshadowing essential safety and compliance considerations.
