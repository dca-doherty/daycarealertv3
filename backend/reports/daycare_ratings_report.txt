OPERATIONAL FACTORS (BALANCED APPROACH):
The rating system includes these operational factors with refined weights:
- Extended hours of operation (early morning: +0.03, evening: +0.06, 24-hour: +0.09)
- Weekend availability (Saturday: +0.03, Sunday: +0.06, 7-day: +0.09)
- Acceptance of child care subsidies (+0.06)
- Specialized infant care (+0.06) and broad age range coverage (+0.03)
- Facility size and capacity (+0.03 for large facilities)
- Operational status and permit conditions (up to -0.3 penalty)

These factors use a progressive scoring system with diminishing returns:
- First 0.1 points: 100% value
- Next 0.1 points: 80% value
- Next 0.1 points: 60% value
- Next 0.1 points: 40% value
- Any additional: 20% value

The maximum quality boost is capped at +0.4 stars, with stronger penalties
for facilities with permit conditions or temporary closures (max 2.5 stars).

NEW TIERED RATING SYSTEM:
In addition to the overall star rating, each daycare is now evaluated on four key dimensions
using a 1-10 scale for more granular assessment:

1. Safety & Compliance (1-10): Regulatory compliance and safety metrics
2. Operational Quality (1-10): Hours, weekend availability, accessibility features
3. Educational Programming (1-10): Curriculum quality and educational approach
4. Staff Qualifications (1-10): Staff education, certification, and professional development

This tiered system allows parents to see both a simple overall rating and detailed
category-specific scores that align with their individual priorities.
