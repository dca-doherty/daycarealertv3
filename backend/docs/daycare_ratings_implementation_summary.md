# DaycareAlert Rating System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the database tables, scripts, and API endpoints created for the enhanced DaycareAlert rating system. This implementation includes both a traditional star rating system (1-5 stars) and a new tiered rating system with subcategory scores (1-10 scale) to provide more granular evaluation of daycare facilities.

## Database Tables

### 1. `daycare_ratings`

The primary table storing all rating data for daycare facilities.

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE daycare_ratings (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  operation_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  overall_rating DECIMAL(2,1) NOT NULL,
  
  /* Original category ratings */
  safety_rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  health_rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  wellbeing_rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  facility_rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  admin_rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  
  /* New subcategory ratings on 1-10 scale */
  safety_compliance_score DECIMAL(3,1),
  operational_quality_score DECIMAL(3,1),
  educational_programming_score DECIMAL(3,1),
  staff_qualifications_score DECIMAL(3,1),
  
  /* Original fields */
  risk_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  violation_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  high_risk_violation_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  recent_violations_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  rating_factors TEXT,
  quality_indicators TEXT,
  
  /* Additional data for tiered display */
  subcategory_data TEXT,
  
  last_updated TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  UNIQUE KEY (operation_id),
  INDEX (overall_rating),
  INDEX (safety_rating),
  INDEX (health_rating),
  INDEX (safety_compliance_score),
  INDEX (operational_quality_score)
)
```

**Key Fields:**
- `overall_rating`: The main 1-5 star rating (0.5 star increments)
- `safety_compliance_score`: 1-10 score for regulatory compliance and safety
- `operational_quality_score`: 1-10 score for operational factors (hours, weekend availability, etc.)
- `educational_programming_score`: 1-10 score for curriculum and educational approach
- `staff_qualifications_score`: 1-10 score for staff credentials and training
- `rating_factors`: JSON-formatted text storing factors that influenced the rating
- `quality_indicators`: JSON-formatted text storing quality indicators detected
- `subcategory_data`: JSON-formatted text with additional data for subcategory display

### 2. `daycare_ratings_backup`

An optional backup table created with the same schema as `daycare_ratings` to store historical versions of ratings.

### 3. `daycare_ratings_balanced`

An optional table with the same schema as `daycare_ratings` for experimenting with balanced rating distributions.

## API Routes

### 1. `/routes/ratings.js`

Standard ratings API endpoints (existing)

### 2. `/routes/tiered_ratings.js`

New API endpoints for the tiered rating system:

- **GET `/api/ratings/tiered`**
  - Returns a list of all daycare ratings with subcategory scores
  - Suitable for listing views
  - Includes basic daycare information and all score types

- **GET `/api/ratings/tiered/operation/:operationId`**
  - Returns detailed rating information for a specific daycare
  - Includes all subcategory scores
  - Includes detailed quality indicators and rating factors

- **GET `/api/ratings/tiered/distribution/subcategories`**
  - Returns statistical information about subcategory score distributions
  - Provides averages, ranges, and histograms for each subcategory

## Rating Algorithm Details

### Overall Star Rating (1-5 Stars)

The overall star rating calculation follows this process:
1. Base rating determined from risk score or violation history
2. Category adjustments based on specific regulatory categories
3. Quality indicator boost based on operational factors (with diminishing returns)
4. Rating ceilings applied based on risk levels and operational status
5. Final rating rounded to nearest 0.5 stars

### Subcategory Ratings (1-10 Scale)

Each subcategory uses a specialized calculation:

1. **Safety & Compliance Score**
   - Based on risk scores and violation patterns
   - Higher scores indicate better compliance and safety

2. **Operational Quality Score**
   - Based on operational conveniences like hours, weekend availability
   - Assesses accessibility features like subsidy acceptance
   - Default of 5 with adjustments for each detected feature

3. **Educational Programming Score**
   - Based on curriculum methods and accreditations
   - Detects educational keywords in program descriptions

4. **Staff Qualifications Score**
   - Based on staff credentials, training, and experience
   - Detects qualification keywords in program descriptions

## Operational Factors

The system evaluates these operational factors with the following weight structure:

1. **Hours of Operation**
   - Early morning care (before 6:30 AM): +0.03 stars
   - Evening/extended care (after 6:30 PM): +0.06 stars
   - 24-hour care: +0.09 stars

2. **Weekend Availability**
   - Saturday care: +0.03 stars
   - Sunday care: +0.06 stars
   - 7-day operation: +0.09 stars

3. **Accessibility**
   - Accepts child care subsidies: +0.06 stars

4. **Age Range Flexibility**
   - Specialized infant care: +0.06 stars
   - Broad age range coverage: +0.03 stars

5. **Facility Characteristics**
   - Large capacity facility (>100 children): +0.03 stars

6. **Operational Status Penalties**
   - Special conditions on permit: -0.3 stars
   - Temporarily closed/inactive: Maximum rating capped at 2.5 stars

## Progressive Scoring System

To prevent rating inflation, a progressive scoring system with diminishing returns is applied:
- First 0.1 points: 100% value
- Next 0.1 points: 80% value
- Next 0.1 points: 60% value
- Next 0.1 points: 40% value
- Any additional: 20% value

The total quality boost is capped at 0.4 stars regardless of how many quality indicators are present.

## Rating Distribution

The current rating distribution (as of implementation):

| Rating | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| 5.0    | 42.9%      |
| 4.5    | 27.5%      |
| 4.0    | 15.0%      |
| 3.5    | 7.9%       |
| 3.0    | 3.5%       |
| 2.5    | 1.8%       |
| 2.0    | 0.8%       |
| 1.5    | 0.3%       |
| 1.0    | 0.1%       |

### Database Access

To display the rating data on the website:

1. Make sure your frontend has access to the `daycare_ratings` table through your existing database connection

2. Use the new API endpoints in `/routes/tiered_ratings.js` for accessing the data

### Frontend Display Recommendations

1. **Daycare Listing Pages**
   - Display the overall star rating (1-5 stars) prominently
   - Add a small indicator showing subcategory scores are available (e.g., "View detailed scores")

2. **Daycare Detail Pages**
   - Show the overall star rating at the top
   - Display a radar chart or bar graph of the four subcategory scores (1-10)
   - Include tooltips explaining each subcategory
   - List specific quality indicators detected for each daycare

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Allow filtering by overall rating (e.g., "4+ stars")
   - Add advanced filtering by subcategory scores (e.g., "Safety score 8+")
   - Enable sorting by different subcategories

4. **User Customization**
   - Consider adding a feature where users can set their priorities
   - Generate a personalized score based on subcategory weights chosen by the user

### Example API Usage

```javascript
// Fetching ratings for daycare listing
fetch('/api/ratings/tiered')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Display ratings in a list
    data.ratings.forEach(daycare => {
      // Access overall_rating for star display
      // Access subcategory scores for additional info
    });
  });

// Fetching detailed rating for a specific daycare
fetch(`/api/ratings/tiered/operation/${operationId}`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    const rating = data.rating;
    
    // Access overall star rating
    displayStarRating(rating.overall_rating);
    
    // Access subcategory scores for detailed display
    displaySubcategoryScores({
      safety: rating.safety_compliance_score,
      operational: rating.operational_quality_score,
      educational: rating.educational_programming_score,
      staff: rating.staff_qualifications_score
    });
    
    // Access detailed quality indicators
    displayQualityIndicators(rating.quality_indicators);
  });
```
