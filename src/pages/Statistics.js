              <h2>Daycare Abuse Risk Analysis</h2>
              <p>We've developed a comprehensive risk model that analyzes daycare abuse probabilities based on facility quality, child age, and other factors. This statistical analysis helps contextualize the raw numbers and provides parents with a clearer understanding of relative risks. Our analysis reveals dramatic differences in risk levels based on several key variables:</p>

              <h3>Key Insights from Our Risk Model</h3>
              <ul className="risk-insights">
                <li><strong>Facility quality matters most:</strong> Children in poor-quality or illegal facilities face 15-37 times higher risk than those in high-quality centers</li>
                <li><strong>Age affects vulnerability:</strong> Infants face approximately 2.3Ã— higher risk than preschoolers due to their inability to communicate</li>
                <li><strong>Risk is unevenly distributed:</strong> The average risk (approximately 1 in 102 over five years) masks dramatic variations based on facility quality and type</li>
                <li><strong>Witnessing vs. experiencing:</strong> The probability of witnessing abuse (1 in 40 over five years) is higher than experiencing it directly</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting varies by abuse type:</strong> Physical abuse is reported at higher rates than neglect, which may be less visible</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="methodology-note">Our statistical model incorporates data from Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, facility quality ratings, age stratification, and evidence-based adjustments for underreporting. Risk probabilities are expressed as 5-year cumulative risks with appropriate statistical correlations.</p>

              <h2>Reporting Child Abuse in Texas</h2>
